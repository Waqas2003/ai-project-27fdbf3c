Snake Game in Python
=====================

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.

To run the game, simply execute `python main.py` in the terminal.

Use the arrow keys to control the snake and eat the apples. The game will end if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

Have fun!
